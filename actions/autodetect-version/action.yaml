name: Autodetect application version
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  This action tries to automatically generate current app version
  It uses two sources of truth:
    * GitHub Workflow Action context;
    * Current git repository state (see 'git describe');

  The action does not mutate any files in repository or affect application builds.
  It only sets 'output.version' the user can then pass to another workflows.
