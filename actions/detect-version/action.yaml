name: Detect application version
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  This action tries to get current code version from git tags:
    * When git tag directly points to the current commit, it is used as
      current version number (v-prefix is trimmed)
    * When no git tag for current commit was found, the version number is
      generated with the following template: '<prev vesrsion>-<branch name>-<ahead commits count>'
      E.g. when the latest tag in repo is v1.3.2 and 'master' branch is ahead of that tag
      by 3 commits, the version for 'master' would be: 1.3.2-master-3

  The action does not mutate any files in repository or affect application builds.
  It only sets outputs the user can then pass to other workflows/jobs/steps.

inputs:
  fetch-depth:
    description: |
      The number of commits of git history from current HEAD to fetch
    required: false
    default: '100'
  canonize:
    description: |
      Canonize version number to make it always look like regular semver: '<major>.<minor>.<patch>'.
      This makes git tag 'v1.1' to produce version '1.1.0' instead of '1.1'.
    required: false
    default: 'false'

outputs:
  current-version:
    description: |
      Version number read from git tags
  current-tag:
    description: |
      Tag used for version detection 'as-is'
  current-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the version belongs to
  previous-version:
    description: |
      Previous version number read from git tags
  previous-tag:
    description: |
      Previous version tag 'as-is'
  previous-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the previous version belongs to
  latest-version:
    description: |
      The latest version number we could read from git tags
  latest-tag:
    description: |
      The latest version tag 'as-is' (sorted as version numbers)
  latest-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the latest version belongs to
  is-branch-head:
    description: |
      Checks if remote version of current branch points to the same SHA as local.

      This can be used to detect old workflow restarts when needed, for example
      to prevent :latest docker image tag from being replaced by old workflow.

runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
