name: Detect application version
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  This action tries to get current code version from git tags:
    * When git tag directly points to the current commit, it is used as
      current version number (v-prefix is trimmed)
    * When no git tag for current commit was found, the version number is
      generated with the following template: '<prev vesrsion>-<branch name>-<ahead commits count>'
      E.g. when the latest tag in repo is v1.3.2 and 'master' branch is ahead of that tag
      by 3 commits, the version for 'master' would be: 1.3.2-master-3

  The action does not mutate any files in repository or affect application builds.
  It only sets outputs the user can then pass to other workflows/jobs/steps.
